NAME
    DB::Pluggable - Add plugin support for the Perl debugger

VERSION
    version 1.101050

SYNOPSIS
        $ cat ~/.perldb

        use DB::Pluggable;
        use Hook::Modular::Builder;
        my $config = builder {
            log_level 'error';
            enable 'BreakOnTestNumber';
            enable 'StackTraceAsHTML';
            enable 'TypeAhead', type => [ '{l', 'c' ] if $ENV{DBTYPEAHEAD};
            enable 'Dumper';
        };

        $DB::PluginHandler = DB::Pluggable->new(config => $config);
        $DB::PluginHandler->run;

    Alternatively, build the configuration yourself, for example, using
    YAML:

        $ cat ~/.perldb

        use DB::Pluggable;
        use YAML;

        $DB::PluginHandler = DB::Pluggable->new(config => Load <<EOYAML);
        global:
          log:
            level: error

        plugins:
          - module: BreakOnTestNumber
        EOYAML

        $DB::PluginHandler->run;

    Then:

        $ perl -d foo.pl

DESCRIPTION
    This class adds plugin support to the Perl debugger. It is based on
    Hook::Modular, so see its documentation for details.

    You need to have a "~/.perldb" file (see perldebug for details) that
    invokes the plugin mechanism. The one in the synopsis will do, and there
    is a more commented one in this distribution's "etc/perldb" file.

    Plugins should live in the "DB::Pluggable::" namespace, like
    DB::Pluggable::BreakOnTestNumber does.

METHODS
  enable_watchfunction
    Tells the debugger to call "DB::watchfunction()", which in turn calls
    the "db.watchfunction" hook on all plugins that have registered it.

  run
    First it calls the "plugin.init" hook, then it enables hooks for the
    relevant debugger commands (see above for which hooks are available).

    Each command-related hook should return the appropriate constant from
    DB::Pluggable::Constants - either "HANDLED" if the hook has handled the
    command, or "DECLINED" if it didn't. If no hook has "HANDLED" the
    command, the default command subroutine (e.g., "DB::cmd_b()") from
    "perl5db.pl" will be called.

HOOKS
    This class is very much in beta, so it's more like a proof of concept.
    Therefore, not all hooks imaginable have been added, only the ones to
    make this demo work. If you want more hooks or if the current hooks
    don't work for you, let me know.

    The following hooks exist:

    "plugin.init"
        Called at the beginning of the "run()" method. The hook doesn't get
        any arguments.

    "db.watchfunction"
        Called from within "DB::watchfunction()". If you want the debugger
        to call the function, you need to enable it by calling
        "enable_watchfunction()" somewhere within your plugin. It's a good
        idea to enable it as late as possible because it is being called
        very often. See the DB::Pluggable::BreakOnTestNumber source code for
        an example. The hook doesn't get any arguments.

    "db.cmd.b"
        Called when the "b" debugger command (used to set breakpoints) is
        invoked. See "run()" below for what the hook should return.

        The hook passes these named arguments:

        "cmd"
            This is the first argument passed to "DB::cmd_b()".

        "line"
            This is the second argument passed to "DB::cmd_b()". This is the
            most important argument as it contains the command line. See the
            DB::Pluggable::BreakOnTestNumber source code for an example.

        "dbline"
            This is the third argument passed to "DB::cmd_b()".

    "db.eval"
        The debugger's "eval()" function is overridden so we can hook into
        it. This is needed to define new debugger commands that take
        arguments. Each plugin that registered this hook will get a chance
        to inspect the command line, which is the last line in $DB::evalarg
        and act on it. Each hook gets passed a code reference in the
        original "DB::eval()" function. If a plugin decides the handle the
        command, it needs to call the original function and return "HANDLED"
        - see DB::Pluggable::Constants - to indicate that it has done so. If
        a plugin does not want to handle the command, it must return
        "DECLINED".

        The hook passes these named arguments:

        "eval"
            The code reference to the original "DB::eval()" function.

    For example, if you wanted to define a new "xx" debugger command, you
    could use:

        sub register {
            my ($self, $context) = @_;
            $context->register_hook(
                $self,
                'db.eval' => $self->can('eval'),
            );
        }

        sub eval {
            my ($self, $context, $args) = @_;
            return DECLINED unless $DB::evalarg =~ s/\n\s*xx\s+([^\n]+)$/\n $1/;
            ... # handle the actual command
            $args->{eval}->();
            HANDLED;
        }
